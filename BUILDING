* building is done using cmake
 * 'mkdir build', 'cd build', 'cmake ..' to construct a Makefile
 * then run 'make' in the build directory to compile
 * you can run 'ccmake ..' in the build directory to change compile options

* if you add a CAOS function, you need to:
 * add prototype to caosVM.h
 * add implementation in a caosVM_category.cpp file
 * make sure you add documentation before the implementation in the same format as everything else
 * make sure it works, and add a %status done
